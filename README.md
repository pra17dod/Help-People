# Help-People | HackGujarat 2020

### HELP AND MAKE HEAVEN
A common platform for the affected people and donars.

### The problem Help-people solves
The Gujarat state has recently faced very hardship because of the COVID-19 pandemic and the flood. Many people are affected and they need support in terms of money, food, clothes, etc. But, considering myself as a donor, if I know the particular person, I will surely help him. Similarly, there are many donors, who want to donate, but they don't know the people who actually want help. The same condition is with the affected people, they don't know the platform to ask for help. Although, there are many NGOs and many volunteers who raise the funds.

But, me as a donor, want to be sure that my whole donation is given to the needy. In short, I need transparency and no intermediates. As a solution, we came up with this, making a platform for the donors to do donations to the affected people and affected areas and also affected people can reach out to donors via posts, without any intermediate, just by logging in this website. We can make user verification protocols and make so many features to increase the authenticity of the website so that donors can trust the posts they across.

Also, if any donor wants to organize some campaigns or to distribute some free products such as masks, food packets, then he too can make a post, and people in the location near him can reach him out. This was the main theme behind our project.

### Challenges we ran into
We had faced trouble while deploying our website on Heroku and for uploading images to be taken from a user and upload it on AWS, and some bugs while signing in the website, page navigation and posting the post on the website.

### Technologies we used:
  - Django Framework
  - PostgreSql
  - Heroku
